			<h2>2. Universal X1 Slitter Rewinder</h2>

			<p id="withimage">

				The Universal X1 is a slitter rewinder designed primarily to slit down small roll sizes, but has the flexibility to meet a wide range of converting needs.  Available with either shear, razor or crush slitting, this low cost, small footprint slitting machine is suitable for a wide range of materials and can be fitted with web tension options.
				
				<br/>
				
				<br/>
				
				The Universal X1 is available in the following variants:

			<h3>Key Benefits</h3>
			
			<p id="withoutimage">
			
				<b>Compact Design</b>
				
				<br/>
				
				The Universal X1 has a small footprint and a short web path.
			
			</p>
			
			<p id="withoutimage">
			
				<b>Substantial construction</b>
				
				<br/>
				
				The X1 utilises cross braced frames, precision bored as a pair. The rollers are aluminium tubes precisely machined and balanced.
				
			</p>
			
			<p id="withoutimage">
			
				<b>Simple operation</b>
				
				<br/>
				
				Adjustable parameters have been minimised, so an operator can be trained in just a few hours. We believe the X6 is about as simple to operate as a duplex centre-wind slitter can be.
				
			</p>
			
			<p id="withoutimage">
				
				<b>Safety</b>
				
				<br/>
				
				Universal ensures its machines conform to international safety standards including EN 13418:2008.
				
			</p>
			
			<p id="withoutimage">
			
				<b>No hydraulics</b>
				
				<br/>
				
				We do not use hydraulic systems for guiding or roll lift in, eliminating the risk of material contamination.
				
			</p>
			
			<p id="withoutimage">
			
				<b>Worldwide support</b>
				
				<br/>
				
				Same day support is available by telephone, and additionally Internet support is available.  Service engineers are normally available within 48 hours.
				
				<br/>
				
				Additional support (drive system) can be obtained from Control Techniques LLC, a full list of worldwide service locations can be found at <a href="http://www.universalconvertingequipment.com/ct">www.universalconvertingequipment.com/ct</a>
